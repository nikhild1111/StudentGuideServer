# StudentGuide - Complete Academic Companion Platform

A comprehensive full-stack MERN application designed to solve real-world problems faced by students in their academic journey. StudentGuide is your one-stop solution for finding hostels, food services, buying/selling books, connecting with guides, and getting mentorship - all in one centralized platform.

## 🎯 The Problem & Solution

During my third year of college, I noticed students constantly struggling to find basic necessities like accommodation, affordable food, study materials, and academic guidance. Information was scattered across WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages, and word-of-mouth, making everything inefficient and time-consuming.

**StudentGuide was born to centralize everything students need** - from hostel hunting to mentor connections - making student life simpler and more organized.
